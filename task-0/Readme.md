Finally completed task 0 i.e dualbooting the pc with ubuntu
This task helped me to get knowledge of different BIOS system (Legacy and UEFI)
Due to secure boot i was facing a loot of issue but after searching got to know how to disable the secure boot by setting BIOS password
After disabling secure boot ubuntu was installed but system was booting only windows  even after.
So after facing too much trouble i watched some youtube videos to solve the issue so i got to know that i have to enable the secure boot again.
After changing setting windows with ubnuntu :- system is dualbooted
