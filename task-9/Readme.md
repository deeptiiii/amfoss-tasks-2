The task was some what tricky starting with forking the github/personal-website and installing jekyll by running ruby cmd.
This took a lot of time in execution
Then browsing to local host but unable to publish the website
This was the main issue i was facing after exploring i came to know how to publish through github
Finally personally website got publish
